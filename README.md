i have used the last fm api to create a dataset to train and test my model. work is still going on and i aim to create a datset of at least 10,000+ songs. there are a lot of datasets already available for karaoke systems but most of them don't have appropriate features assigned that i would need for this model, like {pitch, language, popularity, mood, etc} for the recommendation system to be accurate for a largely hindi-speaking crowd of ages 20-25.
